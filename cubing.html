                <div class="bubble">
                    <p>My cubing journey began in September of 2022 when a <a href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/">friend</a> offered to teach me how to cube. I completed on my own for the first time a few days later, on October 4th. Ever since then, I have been continually practicing to get faster.</p>
                    <p>Some facts about me:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I solve using the <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CFOP_method">CFOP method</a>.</li>
                        <li>Currently, my global average is ~20 seconds.</li>
                        <li>My main cube is the MoYu RS3 M 2021.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Things I'm working on: learning PLL, improving F2L execution, better inspection, practice lookahead.</p>
                    <p>PLLs learned: Aa Ab F Ga H Ja Jb Na Nb Ra Rb T Ua Ub V Y Z</p>
                    <p>PLLs not learned: E Gb Gc Gd</p>
                    <p>The next event I want to learn is: 3BLD!</p>

                    <p><b>2024 Jul 18</b>: I am <i>finally</i> sub-20! Turns out that the secret was... cleaning and re-lubing my cube.</p>
                    <img src="images/cube-time-trend.png">
                    <p>Current PBs: 19.54 (ao100), 18.90 (ao12), 17.48 (ao5).</p>

                    <p><b>2024 Jul 7</b>: A much belated update regarding the competition and other cubing happenings. 3x3 was okay; I was on track for a 21 ao5 (which is about what I average at home) but unfortunately choked on the last solve. I did get a PR single, though! 2x2 was not particularly noteworthy, but competing in Skewb for the first time was quite fun. I probably should have practiced more though, seeing how I shaved ten whole seconds off my average in the days following the competition. Ended up skipping day 2 (pyraminx/3BLD) due to exhaustion.</p>
                    <p>I also helped build a cube mosaic for the first time!</p>

                    <p><b>2024 Jun 14</b>: Signed up for Bay Area Speedcubin' 63! This time, I'll be trying three new events (3BLD, OH, and Skewb) in addition to 2x2/3x3/pyra. I've gotten decently comfortable with Skewb and am averaging about 30 seconds, but my OH solves are just excruciating and I haven't actually learned 3BLD yet, so...</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bubble">
                    <p><b>2024 Mar 31</b>: Went to another cubing competition, <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/BayAreaSpeedcubin59SSF2024">Bay Area Speedcubin' 59</a>! I mainly went since I wanted to record my first official 2x2 and Pyraminx times; I haven't really gotten much faster at 3x3 since my last comp, so I wasn't expecting much in that department. I ended up doing pretty poorly in 3x3 anyways due to nerves, but 2x2 and Pyra were pretty fun. I also got to meet <a href="https://tomas.rokicki.com/">Tomas Rokicki</a>, notable cube mathematician and part of the team that proved God's number to be 20.</p>
                    <p>Thoughts on the competition itself: the new <a href="https://speedcubing.org/blogs/news/timebase-project">Timebase</a> system they were testing felt a little flaky, and in fact I ended up getting an extra for 3x3 due to a malfunction during inspection. The old method of paper scorecards definitely has its problems, and I feel like if it can live up to its promises Timebase would be a big improvement, but it's not quite there yet. I <i>did</i> very much appreciate the choice to run a stationary competition (you do all your solves at the same station). Given the vast confusion that comes with everyone running around, this feels like a no-brainer decision.</p>
                    <p>Overall: pretty good experience. I had a wonderful time judging and chatting with competitors in between solves. This comp has motivated me to practice until I average sub-20, so I am now on the battle path!</p>

                    <p><b>2024 Mar 19</b>: First cubing update in <i>forever</i>: I got a Skewb! It was a much-delayed Secret Santa gift&mdash;long story. Anyways, I haven't formally learned how to solve it, but I devised a really crappy method by just tinkering with the puzzle for a while. Skewb is one of the events at the competition I've signed up for, but unfortunately I can't add it since registration closed, so I'll have to wait to get an official Skewb average.</p>

                    <p><b>2023 Sep 10</b>: Wow, it's been a long time since I've posted an update. Progress has been slow&mdash;<i>very</i> slow&mdash;but steady. My ao100 is at just over 21 seconds, so I think sub-20 is in reach. For reference, my best ao5 and ao12 are 18.35 and 19.65.</p>

                    <p><b>2023 Jun 12</b>: From this day on I am officially a proud Pyraminx owner. I saw the puzzle on sale at Target and simply couldn't resist! The turning is pretty crappy, but nothing a little lube can't fix. After playing with it for a few days I've set and broken a few personal bests which I have recorded below.</p>

                    <p><b>2023 Mar 13</b>: Two big accomplishments&mdash;sub-23 ao100 and a new PB of 12.71! I absolutely did not expect to beat my previous record by such a wide margin. The scramble was ridiculously lucky (XCross and two free pairs after solving the first). I've linked the reconstruction in my PB table.</p>

                    <p>Noisy celebration followed. It was a very exciting achievement; I think I'll be averaging under 20 seconds consistently soon.</p>
