                <div class="bubble">
                    <p>My cubing journey began in September of 2022 when a <a href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/">friend</a> offered to teach me how to cube. I completed on my own for the first time a few days later, on October 4th. Ever since then, I have been continually practicing to get faster.</p>
                    <p>Some facts about me:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I solve using the <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CFOP_method">CFOP method</a>.</li>
                        <li>Currently, my global average is ~20 seconds.</li>
                        <li>My main cube is the MoYu RS3 M 2021.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Things I'm working on: learning PLL, improving F2L execution, better inspection, lookahead.</p>
                    <p>PLLs learned: Aa Ab F Ga H Ja Jb Na Nb Ra Rb T Ua Ub V Y Z</p>
                    <p>PLLs not learned: E Gb Gc Gd</p>
                    <p>The next event I want to learn is: 3BLD!</p>

                    <p><b>19 Sep 2023</b>: First cubing update in <i>forever</i>: I got a Skewb! It was a much-delayed Secret Santa gift&hellip; it's a long story. Anyways, I haven't formally learned how to solve it, but I devised a really crappy method by just tinkering with the puzzle for a while. I'll take a picture once I get home from college.</p>

                    <p><b>10 Sep 2023</b>: Wow, it's been a long time since I've posted an update. Progress has been slow&mdash;<i>very</i> slow&mdash;but steady. My ao100 is at just over 21 seconds, so I think sub-20 is in reach. For reference, my best ao5 and ao12 are 18.35 and 19.65.</p>

                    <p><b>12 Jun 2023</b>: From this day on I am officially a proud Pyraminx owner. I saw the puzzle on sale at Target and simply couldn't resist! The turning is pretty crappy, but nothing a little lube can't fix. After playing with it for a few days I've set and broken a few personal bests which I have recorded below.</p>

                    <p><b>13 Mar 2023</b>: Two big accomplishments&mdash;sub-23 ao100 and a new PB of 12.71! I absolutely did not expect to beat my previous record by such a wide margin. The scramble was ridiculously lucky (XCross and two free pairs after solving the first). I've linked the reconstruction in my PB table.</p>

                <div class="bubble">
                    <p><b>13 Feb 2023</b>: Just got my first ever sub-20 ao5! The times were: 19.26 18.77 19.88 (21.60) (16.52).</p>
                    <p>Noisy celebration followed. It was a very exciting achievement; I think I'll be averaging under 20 seconds consistently soon.</p>

                    <p><b>8 Feb 2023:</b> Got a crazy new PB of 14.97. This solve was quite lucky&mdash;I got an unplanned XCross in 5 moves. Reconstruction is linked in my PB table.</p>
