                    <p>My cubing journey began in September of 2022 when a <a href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/">friend</a> offered to teach me how to cube. I completed a solve without any assistance for the first time a few days later, on October 4th. Ever since then, I have been continually practicing to get faster.</p>
                    <p>Some facts about me:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I solve using the <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CFOP_method">CFOP method</a>.</li>
                        <li>Currently, my global average is ~22 seconds.</li>
                        <li>My main cube is the MoYu RS3 M 2021.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Things I'm working on: learning PLL, improving F2L execution, better inspection, lookahead.</p>
                    <p>PLLs learned: F H Ja Jb Na Nb Ra Rb T Ua Ub Y Z</p>
                    <p>PLLs not learned: Aa Ab E Ga Gb Gc Gd V</p>

                    <p><b>13 Mar 2023</b>: Two big accomplishments&mdash;sub-23 ao100 and a new PB of 12.71! I absolutely did not expect to beat my previous record by such a wide margin. The scramble was ridiculously lucky (XCross and two free pairs after solving the first). I've linked the reconstruction in my PB table.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bubble">
                    <p><b>13 Feb 2023</b>: Just got my first ever sub-20 ao5! The times were: 19.26 18.77 19.88 (21.60) (16.52).</p>
                    <p>Noisy celebration followed. It was a very exciting achievement; I think I'll be averaging under 20 seconds consistently soon.</p>

                    <p>Practicing 2x2 was fun, although going back to 3x3 felt extremely weird.</p>

                    <p><b>8 Feb 2023:</b> Got a crazy new PB of 14.97. This solve was quite lucky&mdash;I got an unplanned XCross in 5 moves. Reconstruction is linked in my PB table.</p>
